# French Words of the Day
A simple Python tool that pops 5 random French words every day with desktop notifications.

## Motivation
I created this project while learning Python and French. It combines language learning with automation, notifications, and file handling. Along the way, I solved common problems like:
- Avoiding repeated words until all are used
- Cross-platform notifications on Mac
- Scheduling a script daily with cron

## How It Works
1. Reads a vocabulary file (`levocab.txt`) containing French words.
2. Tracks previously used words in `history.txt`.
3. Picks 5 random words each day that havenâ€™t been used recently.
4. Sends a macOS desktop notification using `pync`.
5. Can be scheduled with `cron` to run automatically.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mboatella25/Word-generator-pop-up.git
cd Word-generator-pop-up
